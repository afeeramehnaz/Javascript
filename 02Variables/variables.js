/*
null is a value that indicates the absence of any object value. It's a deliberate assignment to a variable to signify that it has no value or that it's empty. It's a primitive value.

undefined typically means that a variable has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value. It's a bit different from null in that it usually indicates that a variable has not yet been given a value or doesn't exist in a certain context. It's also a primitive value.
